# React + Typescript Boilerplate

This is my own little sandbox starting point, configured to have the
option of building an app usable offline.

Use `npm start` to have a live dev server.

Use `npm run build` to delete the previous build and dump a built
index.html + app.js + resource files into the build folder.

Use `npm run clean` to delete the build folder.
